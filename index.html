                <p><b>Eric Theodore Cartman</b>, usually referred to as just Cartman, is one of the main characters,
                    along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick.
                    Cartman is sometimes the main antagonist of an episode.
                    None of the other three main children really consider Cartman their friend and do not know why they
                    started hanging out with him in the first place, but a certain form of unstable friendship ends up
                    being born between them.</p>
